# Sinatra Travel App

The Sinatra Travel App is a simple travel log/memory storage app.  It allows users to login, signup, and create travel entries about places they have been and help them remember the places the things better.  Users can also edit and delete their own entries. 

## Getting Started

To run this app, clone the repo and run `bundle install`.  Then run `shotgun` to fire up a server.  You should see the app running on `localhost:9393`.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Ruby installed on your machine - Linux or Mac.
